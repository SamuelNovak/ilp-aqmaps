# Informatics Large Practical - Air Quality Maps

This project was a coursework assignment in the course Informatics Large Practical at the University of Edinburgh.
*(Marks not released yet)*

## Description

The problem is as follows: There is a (fictional) research team evaluating air quality in an urban area. For a pilot project, they set up a collection of sensors in and around the Central Campus of the University of Edinburgh, and they need an autonomous drone to visit those sensors and collect their readings.

My task was to design and implement the software controlling this drone, including navigation and control. Finally, the program simulated the drone's flight and exported the collected data as a precise log of the drone's operation, as well as a colour-coded map showing its trajectory and air quality readings.

## Technical details

This project uses the Maven build system. Dependencies include MapBox GEOJson and Google GSON.
